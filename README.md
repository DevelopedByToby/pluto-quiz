# Pluto 🪐

A small space themed quiz run by quiz master Pluto! I built this super simple quiz for a school project! I then decided to turn it into a quiz that you can play in your very own terminal.

### Getting started

1. Run the following command in your terminal

```
npx pluto-quiz
```

Then, you're all done! NPM might prompt you to install some extra packages, if so, make sure just to hit `y`.

### Feedback

If you have any suggestions, or are running into any issues, please open an issue! I can then try to help :)
